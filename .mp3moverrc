#%r = Artist, %a = Album, %n = song number, %t = Song Title
#%ur = ARTIST, %ua = ALBUM, %ut = SONG TITLE
#%lr = artist, %la = album, %lt = song title
#%fr = first character of artist's name


DIRECTORYMASK='%r_-_%a'
#this is like the FILEMASK, you want to use "/" as the delimeter, trust me.
#if the album isn't found in the song title then that directory just won't be
#created

ID3TITLEMASK='%n - %t'
#title doesn't include the filename extension for this one
#also behaves sensibly as FILEMASK does
